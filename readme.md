Personal Portfolio Site for Sebastian Flores

Overview:
This is my personal portfolio built using HTML-5 and CSS-3. This portfolio includes various pages, with those being Home, About, Projects, and Contact.

Repository: https://github.com/sebastianflores-tech/Portfolio-Website
Live Website: https://sebastianflores-tech.github.io/Portfolio-Website/

Adaptive Display for multiple view ports:

Laptop → laptop.css applies for screens ≥ 960px
Tablet → tablet.css applies for screens 481px – 960px
Mobile → mobile.css applies for screens ≤ 480px

I chose these  because they are standard device sizes and ensure accessibility across the devices

Gradients:

Linear Gradient applied to the banner
Angle Gradient applied to in Contact

Color Scheme:
Main Scheme consisted of:
#89C8F0
#5EC1FF
Gray

Chose these colors as blue and gray are my favourite colors, seemed fitting for a portfolio about me.
